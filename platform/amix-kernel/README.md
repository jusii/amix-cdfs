# AMIX (SVR4/m68k) — the in-kernel `cdfs` filesystem

This directory is the actual deliverable of the AMIX port: a read-only optical
filesystem that lives **inside the SVR4 kernel** as a real vfs/vnode
filesystem, so `mount -F cdfs 0,2 /cdrom` gives every process on the box a CD
under `/cdrom`. The portable ODFS core and backend parsers do the format work
unchanged; everything here is the SVR4 glue that makes them mountable, plus the
kernel-side SCSI transport that feeds them sectors.

The userspace half — the mount helper `mount -F cdfs` execs, and the media
backends the cross-built tools use — is next door in
[`platform/amix/`](../amix/README.md).

|---|---:|---|

## Building — `make amix-kernel`

```sh
make amix-kernel                                      # -> build/amix-kernel/libcdfskern.o
make amix-kernel AMIX_CROSS_PREFIX=/path/to/amix-cross
```

The output is **one relocatable object**, not an executable and not a loadable
module — AMIX has no loadable filesystems. Three things make this build differ
from the userspace `make amix` arm:

1. **`-DODFS_PLATFORM_AMIX_KERNEL -D_KERNEL`** selects the kernel arm at each of
   the four portable seams — allocation via `kmem`, no `<stdio.h>`, the bounded
   formatter, and the fixed-width-type shim — so nothing here needs libc or a
   syscall. `_KERNEL` also turns on the `sys/*.h` kernel declarations that
   `systm.h` gates `sleep`/`wakeup`/`bcopy` behind, and that the alien `sd.h`
   ABI requires.
2. **The gcc wrapper is bypassed for the final link.** The cross `gcc` is a
   wrapper that always injects `crt1`/`crti`/`crtn` and libc, which is exactly
   wrong for a kernel object, so the objects are combined with the cross
   `ld -r` instead. That leaves every kernel and toolchain extern — `kmem_*`,
   `sdqueue`, `sleep`/`wakeup`, `spl*`, `vtop`, `memcpy`/`strlen`, `vfssw`,
   `nfstype` — undefined, to be resolved at the real kernel link.
3. **No `-lgcc`.** The three 64-bit soft-arithmetic helpers (`__udivdi3`,
   `__umoddi3`, `__lshrdi3`) that m68k has no instructions for are left
   undefined **on purpose**, so they bind to the kernel's own `libgcc` copies
   at the whole-kernel link rather than being duplicated into it. That is not a
   cosmetic choice: those helpers are the subject of the closed known-unknown
   §1 in [`docs/amix-known-unknowns.md`](../../docs/amix-known-unknowns.md), and
   a second private copy would have hidden the toolchain bug rather than
   exposing it.

`kstring.o` additionally compiles with **`-fno-builtin`**. Without it GCC
recognizes the byte loops in `memset`/`memcmp` as the very idioms they are
defining and rewrites them into self-calls — infinite recursion. This is the
same freestanding trap `platform/amiga/os4/freestanding.o` guards against.

## How it reaches a kernel — not from here

`build/amix-kernel/libcdfskern.o` on its own does nothing. Two further steps are
required, and **this repository performs neither**:

1. **A `cdfs` row in the kernel's static `vfssw[]` table**
   (`master.d/filesys.c` in the stock `/usr/sys` tree), of the shape
   `{ "cdfs", cdfsinit, 0, 0 }`, with an `extern int cdfsinit();` above it.
2. **A whole-kernel relink** with `libcdfskern.o` among the objects (installed
   as `fs/cdfs/exp` and listed in `OPT_SUBEXP` in `fs/Makefile`) and the cross
   toolchain's `libgcc.a` on the final `ld` line. That link is what resolves all
   the externs `ld -r` left open.

This is the step nobody can guess from the tree, so it is stated here rather
than implied: building `cdfs` and building it into a kernel are separate jobs.
The top-level [README](../../README.md#getting-the-kernel-filesystem-into-a-kernel)
lists the steps; the scripted integration harness this port was validated with
is not published yet.

## The four hard contracts

Each of these is a rule the SVR4 kernel enforces by crashing rather than by
diagnosing, and each was paid for once already.

### 1. Never call `VFS_INIT` from `cdfs_mount` — `0fcf308`

`mount(2)` has **already run** `VFS_INIT` on the vfs by the time a filesystem's
mount routine is called (it is inlined there, right after the `kmem_alloc`), and
it has then called `vfs_lock()`, which ORs `VFS_MLOCK` into `vfs_flag`.
`VFS_INIT` *assigns* `vfs_flag = 0`, so calling it a second time destroys that
live lock bit. On an `MS_REMOUNT` it is worse: `mount(2)` hands the filesystem
the **live** vfs, and `VFS_INIT` would zero `vfs_next` and truncate the global
`rootvfs` list. Stock `s5mount` calls `VFS_INIT` nowhere — it never writes
`vfs_op`, `vfs_next` or `vfs_nsubmounts`, and only ever ORs `vfs_flag`. `cdfs`
does the same.

The same commit fixed the mirror-image defect: `mount(2)` allocates the vfs with
`kmem_alloc`, **not** `kmem_zalloc`, and the inlined `VFS_INIT` clears only five
fields — so `vfs_dev`, `vfs_fsid` and `vfs_bcount` arrive holding whatever the
recycled heap block last contained. `vfs_devsearch()` scans `rootvfs` comparing
`vfs_dev` and `getvfs()` scans it comparing `vfs_fsid`; both hand the matched
`struct vfs *` straight to code that casts `vfs_data` to *its own* private mount
struct. A stale `vfs_dev` on a linked-in vfs is therefore a wild-pointer source
for unrelated kernel code, not a cosmetic defect.

`cdfs` has no block-special device, so it synthesizes one: `cdfsinit()` latches
a single pseudo-major from **`getudev()`** — the kernel's own convention for
device-less filesystems, the way `prinit()` and `fdinit()` do in the same
boot-time walk — and each mount carries `(card,unit)` in the 18 minor bits. The
result is stable across mount/unmount and unique per drive, which is what makes
the duplicate-device guard below possible at all.

### 2. `cdfsinit()` self-locates its `vfssw[]` slot by name — `6446103`

The kernel walks `vfssw[]` at boot calling each `vsw_init` routine. The obvious
implementation trusts a passed `(vswp, fstype)` pair — but the AMIX boot loop
invokes `(*vsw_init)()` with no such arguments, so a declared `vswp` is garbage
and writing through it corrupts an unrelated slot, leaving the real `"cdfs"`
row's `vsw_vfsops` NULL. `mount(2)` then returns EINVAL before it ever
dispatches, with nothing to say why.

So `cdfsinit()` takes no arguments (declared with empty parens, C89
"unspecified arguments", so it binds cleanly however the kernel invokes it),
walks `vfssw[0..nfstype)` itself looking for the row named `"cdfs"`, installs
`&cdfs_vfsops` there, and records the row index as the fstype.

### 3. Every DMA target is page-aligned and may not cross a page — `fa9db1a` + `31e8c3b`

`sc.addr` is a **physical** address (`vtop` of the buffer) and the HBA transfers
`sc.nbyte` bytes linearly through physical memory from it. `vtop()` translates
exactly one page, and SVR4 `kmem`/`sptalloc` memory is virtually contiguous but
**physically scattered** — so any transfer running past the end of the target's
page writes into an unrelated physical frame. On metal that wild write zeroed
the head of cached binaries: it is what was corrupting `/usr/sbin/umount` and
libc.

Two halves, and both are needed:

- `fa9db1a` (in portable `core/`) makes every buffer a media backend DMAs into
  **sector-aligned**, via `odfs_malloc_aligned`.
- `31e8c3b` (here) makes the contract **enforced rather than assumed**:
  `amix_kern_submit()` refuses — loudly, with a `cmn_err(CE_WARN)` — any request
  whose in-page offset plus length exceeds `NBPP`, and `read_sectors()` routes
  any unaligned caller through a page-aligned bounce sector plus a `memcpy`
  rather than firing a wild DMA. The bounce is allocated per call, not per
  mount, because the submit sleep is a reschedule point and concurrent readers
  of one mount must not share one.

**On 4 KiB-page kernels the same object stays correct.** `NBPP` comes from the
stock headers, so the object enforces the rule at 2048 bytes even where the
68040/68060 kernels run 4096-byte pages. That is stricter, never weaker: a
2048-aligned 2048-byte transfer always sits inside one 4096-byte page, so
one object serves both kernel lines. Nothing else in the read path depends on
the page size. A read returns min(request, size - offset) bytes, never fewer.
`tests/unit/test_read_span.c` checks both at a 2048 and a 4096 runtime page.

### 4. A `struct sdcom` handed to `sdqueue()` must never live on the kernel stack — `9360542`

On AMIX the kernel stack lives in the **per-process u-area window** — a fixed
virtual range that is remapped at every context switch. An interrupt-completing
HBA driver (a3091/a4091) delivers completion from its ISR in whatever process
context the interrupt happens to land in. While the submitter sleeps, another
process is on-CPU, and the driver's `cp` — a u-area-window address — resolves
into *that* process's stack: the ISR writes `cp->okay`/`cp->status` into the
victim's frames and jumps through a garbage `cp->intr`. That is the
`psw=0x2200` wild-pc KERNEL FAULT in an unrelated process, seen on the bench as
a panic inside `flopd`.

Every stock `sd` client obeys this contract with permanent sdcoms (`dd.c` uses
`ddtab[][].com`; `scsi.c`'s `gsioctl` uses a file-static). `cdfs` was the sole
violator. Each request is now a `kmem`-heap allocation — globally mapped in
every context — freed only after the completion handler has fired.

A synchronous, in-context driver (today's `z3660scsi`) never dereferences
cross-context, which is why the z3660scsi card survived what the a3091 card
died of. Do not read that as the rule being optional.

## Mount refusals, and what each errno means

`mount(2)` returns an errno and nothing else, so the distinctions
`cdfs_errno()` ([`cdfs_node.c`](cdfs_node.c)) preserves are the **only**
diagnosis a failed mount gets. `e0ef11a` exists because they were not preserved:
an unregistered card, a wire fault, a disc with no filesystem and a
512-byte-block device were one indistinguishable errno 5, and that cost three
separate investigations.

| errno | What it means | First thing to check |
|---|---|---|
| `ENXIO` | No controller registered at that card index — the address names nothing at all. `sdopen()` said so, and a `cmn_err` on the console names the card | The card number. The stock kernel unregisters the a3091 once memory exceeds 64 MB, so `1,3` may be a slot with no controller in it |
| `ENOTTY` | The target answered INQUIRY but is **not** peripheral type 0x05 — the device is there, it is just not a CD drive. Produced nowhere else in cdfs, so it is an unambiguous fingerprint | The unit number: this is a hard disk or a tape, not the drive you meant |
| `EINVAL` | Either the disc read fine and no backend recognized a filesystem on it, or the shape is one this driver does not serve (a block size other than 2048, a capacity past READ CAPACITY(10)) — or the mount spec did not parse | The disc, then the spec string |
| `ENOMEM` | `kmem` allocation failed | Kernel memory pressure |
| `EIO` | **Only** "the device did not deliver readable data" | Cable, termination, media |
| `EBUSY` | Either that drive is already mounted somewhere, or that directory already has something mounted on it (see the anti-stacking guard below) | `mount` with no arguments |
| `EROFS` | The caller did not pass `MS_RDONLY` | Use `/usr/lib/fs/cdfs/mount`, which always does |
| `EPERM` | Not the superuser. `mount(2)` itself checks no privilege — every filesystem's `VFS_MOUNT` does | — |
| `ENOTDIR` | The mount point is not a directory | — |

Two of those need their reason stated, because both look like over-strictness:

**`EBUSY` — the anti-stacking guard** (`844c2ed`). `mount(2)`'s only own busy
test is `v_vfsmountedhere` on the vnode `lookupname()` returned. But for a
directory that is *already* mounted on, `lookupname` **traverses into** the
mounted filesystem and returns its root vnode, whose `v_vfsmountedhere` is
clear. So without a guard a second `mount -F cdfs 0,2 /cdrom` does not fail: it
silently mounts on top of the first (rc 0), and `umount` — resolving its path
the same traversing way — then pops one layer per call, returns 0, and leaves
the disc still mounted underneath. "umount succeeded but the CD is still
mounted." `cdfs_mount` therefore refuses `v_count > 1` or `VROOT` on the mount
point, exactly as `prmount`, `fdmount` and `s5mount` do, and mirrors
`s5mount`'s duplicate-device guard via `vfs_devsearch()`.

**`EROFS` without `MS_RDONLY`.** `vfs_add()` runs *after* this routine returns
and rewrites `VFS_RDONLY` from the `mount(2)` flags alone — setting it if
`MS_RDONLY` was passed and **clearing** it otherwise. A `VFS_RDONLY` set inside
`cdfs_mount` cannot survive on its own, so a caller who omitted the flag would
leave the kernel believing a CD is writable. The userland helper always passes
it; refusing anyone who does not is cheaper than depending on the helper being
the only caller.

## Two vectors with no compile-time checking

`struct vfsops` (8 slots) and `struct vnodeops` (37 slots) are K&R
`int (*)()` arrays. Nothing checks a signature, and nothing checks slot order:
the `VFS_*` and `VOP_*` call macros in `<sys/vfs.h>` and `<sys/vnode.h>` **are**
the ABI. Both vectors here are therefore written positionally, in the exact
struct order, with the slot number in a comment on every line. A slot inserted
in the wrong place compiles cleanly and calls the wrong function.

No `vnodeops` slot is left NULL — the generic vnode layer dereferences each one
unconditionally. Ops this read-only filesystem does not implement point at the
kernel's shared `fs_subr` stubs (`fs_nosys`, `fs_setfl`, `fs_frlock`, `fs_poll`,
`fs_pathconf`, `fs_cmp`, `fs_rwlock`, `fs_rwunlock`); every mutating op funnels
to `cdfs_rdonly()`, which returns `EROFS`.

## `<string.h>` is intercepted, and the reason is not source-level

The portable code calls `memcpy`/`memmove`/`memset`/`memcmp`/`strlen`, but the
SVR4 kernel resolves those from two places, not one: `ml/exp` exports **global
`memcpy` and `strlen`**, while **nothing** in the kernel provides `memmove` or
`memset`, and its only `memcmp` is a file-static in `netinet`. So `cdfs` must
define exactly `memmove`, `memset` and `memcmp` (in `kstring.c`) and must **not**
define `memcpy` or `strlen` — a second definition makes the whole-kernel
`ld -r` fail with "multiple definition".

[`compat/string.h`](compat/string.h) is placed ahead of the sysroot on the
include path for this build only, so `#include <string.h>` resolves there and
hands the portable code a minimal const-correct prototype set and nothing else.
It supplies **real symbols rather than a `#define memcpy odfs_kmemcpy`
redirect**, because a macro only catches source-level calls: GCC lowers
aggregate struct copies and zero-inits — such as `cnp->node = *n;`, where the
operand is a several-hundred-byte `odfs_node_t` — to direct `memcpy`/`memset` calls at
codegen time, which no macro can rewrite.

`memmove` is implemented by hand rather than delegated blindly to `bcopy`,
because **`bcopy` is not overlap-safe**: it tail-jumps into `mcpy`, which copies
strictly ascending, and the kernel's `memcpy` is merely a second entry point
into that same routine. `cdfs` has no `memmove` call site of its own, but
`memmove` is a global symbol in the whole-kernel link — so any other kernel code
binding to it was binding to a body that silently corrupts on destructive
overlap.

## No 32x32->64 multiply in the object — it must run on a 68060

The 68060 does not implement `MULU.L`/`MULS.L <ea>,Dh:Dl` (32x32->64) or
`DIVU.L`/`DIVS.L <ea>,Dr:Dq` (64/32); they trap to vector 61, and in kernel
mode nothing emulates them. gcc 2.7.2.3 has no `-m68060`, and with `-m68020`
or `-m68040` it emits the 64-bit multiply on its own for two idioms: a 32-bit
division or modulo by a **constant** (multiply by the reciprocal, keep the high
word) and `(uint64_t)a * b` with two 32-bit operands.

So the kernel arm defines `ODFS_NO_MUL64` (`include/odfs/config.h`), and the
portable code writes those idioms through [`odfs/arith.h`](../../include/odfs/arith.h):
`odfs_udiv32`/`odfs_umod32`/`odfs_sdiv32`/`odfs_smod32`/`odfs_udivsz` hide the
divisor from the optimizer so a plain 32-bit `DIVU.L`/`DIVS.L` is emitted, and
`odfs_umul64` builds the product from 16x16 partials. Without the knob every
helper is a macro for the open-coded operator, so the AmigaOS, host and AMIX
userspace builds compile to the same code as before. Power-of-two divisors need
none of this: they are shifts.

The check is a disassembly scan of the object for the trapping encodings, which
must find **zero** candidates:

```sh
m68k-cbm-sysv4-objdump -d build/amix-kernel/libcdfskern.o > cdfs.lst
scan060.py cdfs.lst            # test-tools/scan060.py in asokero/amix-040-060-port
```

A new division by a constant or a widening multiply in code that reaches the
kernel object brings a candidate back; route it through `odfs/arith.h`.

## Known limits

- **Read-only**, by construction. `vfs_mountroot` returns `EROFS` and
  `vfs_swapvp` returns `EINVAL`: `cdfs` can be neither the root filesystem nor
  a swap device.
- **One 2048-byte sector per SCSI transfer.** Multi-sector requests came back as
  garbage on the bench HBA — the block cache's 8-sector read-ahead returned
  kernel text and then wedged the box — which is the signature of a DMA
  bounce/contiguity limit on that board. `read_sectors()` splits every request
  into single-block commands. Raise `AMIX_KERN_MAX_XFER` only once the HBA's DMA
  limit is known good.
- **ISO 9660 with Rock Ridge is the metal-proven path.** Every backend in
  `CORE_SRCS` compiles into the module, but High Sierra, Joliet, UDF, HFS, HFS+
  and CDDA have not been exercised end to end on hardware — see
  [`docs/amix-known-unknowns.md`](../../docs/amix-known-unknowns.md).
- **The node hash has no bucket locking.** v1 is single-threaded with respect to
  it; SMP hardening is a later step.
- **`vfs_vget` resolves only currently-cached nodes.** Stateless handle
  synthesis for NFS export is out of scope.
- **Not built in CI** — no cross toolchain is available there. See
  [`docs/testing.md`](../../docs/testing.md). On the host, `make check` covers
  `cdfs_blocks.h`, which was factored out of `cdfs_vnodeops.c` precisely so its
  arithmetic could be tested off-metal (`tests/unit/test_cdfs_blocks.c`), and a
  model of the read path (`tests/unit/test_read_span.c`).
