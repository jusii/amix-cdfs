/*
 * cdfs_blocks.h — vattr.va_nblocks (i.e. stat(2)'s st_blocks) for the AMIX
 * in-kernel cdfs.
 *
 * Factored into its own free-standing header for two reasons:
 *
 *   1. TESTABILITY. cdfs_vnodeops.c cannot be compiled on the host (it needs
 *      the SVR4 <sys/vnode.h> kernel headers), so the block-count arithmetic
 *      would otherwise be untestable anywhere but on metal. This header pulls
 *      in nothing at all, so tests/unit/test_cdfs_blocks.c can include it
 *      directly and `make check` covers the mapping.
 *
 *   2. NO 64-BIT DIVISION. See the hazard note below — this must stay 32-bit.
 *
 * ---- units ----
 *
 * SVR4 reports st_blocks in DEV_BSIZE units, NOT in filesystem-block units:
 *   <sys/param.h>:     #define DEV_BSIZE  512
 *                      #define NBPSCTR    512
 *                      #define SCTRSHFT   9
 *   <sys/sysmacros.h>: #define btod(BB)   (((BB) + NBPSCTR - 1) >> SCTRSHFT)
 * and <sys/stat.h> declares `long st_blocks` — a SIGNED long, so a bogus
 * large value shows up in `ls` totals as a huge unsigned number.
 *
 * An ISO9660/UDF file occupies whole 2048-byte logical sectors on the medium,
 * so the allocation is ceil(size / 2048) sectors, and each such sector is
 * 2048/512 == 4 DEV_BSIZE blocks. A 6-byte file therefore reports 4, which is
 * the same convention s5 uses on this box (1339-byte /etc/passwd -> 4).
 *
 * ---- hazard: never use 64-bit division here ----
 *
 * `n->size` is a uint64_t, but va_nblocks is a 32-bit u_long, so the natural
 * expression `(n->size + 2047) / 2048` is a 64-bit divide. On m68k GCC 2.7.2.3
 * that is NOT strength-reduced to a shift: it emits an out-of-line call to
 * __udivdi3, which the cdfs kernel object leaves undefined for amix-kerntools
 * to resolve out of a pushed libgcc.a at the real kernel link. That binding is
 * demonstrably broken on metal — it returns an internal intermediate of the
 * routine's normalization step instead of the quotient (see the 2026-07-19
 * st_blocks investigation). Everything else in cdfs_getattr was correct
 * precisely because no other field needs 64-bit soft arithmetic.
 *
 * So: shift, don't divide. A 32-bit `>>` is inline m68k code and calls
 * nothing. (`__lshrdi3`, the 64-bit shift helper the proven-good read path in
 * odfs_cache_read_bytes() uses, is a different symbol and is NOT implicated.)
