/*
 * kstring.c — the mem primitives the AMIX kernel does NOT already export.
 *
 * The portable core/backends — and GCC's own lowering of aggregate struct
 * copies/zero-inits — reference memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp/strlen. But of
 * those the kernel's ml/exp module ALREADY exports GLOBAL memcpy and strlen,
 * so cdfs must NOT define them: a second definition makes the whole-kernel
 * `ld -o unix -r` fail with "multiple definition of 'memcpy'"/"'strlen'".
 * memcpy and strlen are therefore left as undefined externs (declared in
 * compat/string.h) and resolve to the kernel's ml/exp copies at the final
 * link — the standard ABI every other kernel module relies on.
 *
 * The kernel exports NEITHER memmove NOR memset, and its only memcmp lives in
 * netinet as a static/local symbol (no clash), so cdfs supplies exactly those
 * three here, layered on the kernel's bcopy where that is actually safe.
 *
 * WHAT THE KERNEL'S bcopy REALLY IS — load-bearing for memmove below. bcopy is
 * NOT overlap-safe. It tail-jumps straight into mcpy, which copies strictly
 * ASCENDING (`moveb %a0@+,%a1@+` for the alignment head and tail, `movel
 * %a0@+,%a1@+` for the long-word body) — a plain forward memcpy, and in fact
 * the kernel's own memcpy is just a second entry point into the same mcpy with
 * the arguments swapped. So bcopy may stand in for memmove only when a forward
 * copy is safe; where it is not, memmove must copy backward itself.
 *
 * MUST be compiled with -fno-builtin (see the Makefile per-object override):
 * otherwise GCC recognizes the byte loops below as the very memmove/memset/
 * memcmp idioms and rewrites them into self-calls (infinite recursion) — the
 * same freestanding trap the OS4 handler's freestanding.o guards against.
 *
 * The kernel routines are spelled K&R (no prototype), matching the period
 * kernel's own <sys/systm.h> declarations, and <sys/systm.h> is deliberately
 * NOT included: it would drag in non-const strcmp/strncpy prototypes that clash
 * with the compiler built-ins. bcopy's argument order is (src, dst, n) — the
 * OPPOSITE of memcpy(dst, src, n); the wrappers swap accordingly.

     * HISTORY, corrected — do not reintroduce the old claim. This loop was once
     * justified by "the kernel's bzero does not reliably clear a large region":
     * a ~1.1 KB rr_info_t cleared with memset kept garbage in its tail fields
     * (is_relocated / has_child_link, both at offset > 1024), which made the ISO
     * readdir treat every child as a Rock Ridge relocation and skip it — a
     * directory that read as empty. That diagnosis was WRONG. The kernel's bzero
     * disassembles as a perfectly correct clear (align the destination, byte-fill
     * the head, long-word fill the body, byte-fill the tail). It does not skip
     * tails. The real culprit was the Z3660 firmware's DMA cache-coherence bug —
     * stale lines, not an unclear — and that is fixed (Z3660 0a4c064).
     *
     * The loop stays regardless, on its own merits: memset must fill with an
     * ARBITRARY c, which bzero cannot do, so the general path has to exist
     * anyway; and this is the exact code the current on-metal mount was proven
     * with. Delegating the c == 0 case to bzero is now known to be safe and is a
     * fair later optimization, but it would change a metal-proven path and is
     * deliberately not taken here.
     *
     * -fno-builtin (Makefile per-object) stops GCC from recognizing the loop and
     * emitting a memset self-call.
