 * cdfs_vfsops.c — the SVR4 vfsops vector for the AMIX in-kernel cdfs.
 *
 * Defines cdfs_vfsops POSITIONALLY, in the EXACT slot order of struct vfsops in
 * <sys/vfs.h> (vfs_mount, vfs_unmount, vfs_root, vfs_statvfs, vfs_sync,
 * vfs_vget, vfs_mountroot, vfs_swapvp), plus cdfsinit — the vsw_init routine a
 * later kerntools step wires into the static vfssw[] table. The op vector is a
 * K&R `int (*)()` array with zero compile-time checking, so the VFS_* call
 * macros in <sys/vfs.h> are the ABI and each function matches them exactly.
 *
 * v1 mount interface (flagged for review): the mount `special` argument is an
 * ASCII "<card><sep><unit>" string — <sep> is any run of non-digits, e.g.
 * "0,2", "0.2", "0:2" — naming the SCSI host-adapter index and target id the
 * in-kernel media backend opens. There is no /dev node yet; a real CD never
 * traverses /dev/dsk on stock AMIX, so addressing by (card,unit) sidesteps that
 * until the device-node story is built out.

/*
 * cdfs has no block-special device: it addresses the drive by (card,unit),
 * because a real CD never traverses /dev/dsk on stock AMIX. The kernel does not
 * care — it walks vfs_dev and vfs_fsid on EVERY mounted vfs regardless:
 *
 *   vfs_devsearch(dev)  linearly scans rootvfs comparing the vfs_dev longs
 *                       (no major-range logic anywhere in it), and is called
 *                       from umount(2) — for a BLOCK-SPECIAL argument only;
 *                       a directory argument resolves by VROOT -> v_vfsp and
 *                       never reads vfs_dev — plus bdevbsize(), and from
 *                       s5mount()/ufs_mount() as their duplicate-device mount
 *                       guard (which cdfs_mount now mirrors).
 *   getvfs(fsid)        scans rootvfs comparing vfs_fsid.val[0..1], and is
 *                       called from the NFS fhtovp()/myfhtovp() paths.
 *
 * Both hand the matched `struct vfs *` straight to code that casts vfs_data to
 * ITS OWN private mount struct — so a vfs_dev/vfs_fsid on our vfs that collides
 * with a real filesystem's is a wild-pointer generator, not a cosmetic defect.
 *
 * And they DO arrive as garbage: mount(2) allocates the vfs with kmem_alloc,
 * not kmem_zalloc, and the VFS_INIT it then runs clears only vfs_next, vfs_op,
 * vfs_flag, vfs_data and vfs_nsubmounts. vfs_dev, vfs_fsid and vfs_bcount are
 * left holding whatever the recycled heap block last contained. Stock s5mount
 * therefore sets all of them, and so must we.
 *
 * WHERE THE MAJOR COMES FROM — the kernel's own convention for device-less
 * filesystems, taken from disassembling this exact kernel: prinit() and
 * fdinit() call getudev(), which hands out a unique major from a static
 * counter starting at max(bdevcnt,cdevcnt) and capped at 127, and latch
 * makedevice(udev, 0) into a global (procdev, fddev, fdrdev) ONCE at vsw-init
 * time; prmount/fdmount then stamp that global into vfs_dev and
 * vfs_fsid=(dev, fstype) on every mount. cdfsinit() does exactly that below.
 * The result is deterministic for the whole boot (never recycled kmem
 * garbage), stable across mount/unmount cycles, and collision-free by
 * construction: real block majors live below bdevcnt (32) and getudev never
 * hands the same major out twice.
 *
 * proc and fd are single-instance and use minor 0; cdfs is per-drive, so the
 * 18 minor bits (L_MAXMIN) carry the (card,unit) pair and distinct drives get
 * distinct devs under the one latched major.
 *
 * Fallback: getudev() returns -1 only when majors up to 127 are exhausted
 * (~96 spare on this kernel — cannot happen). prinit's fallback is major 0
 * with a CE_WARN; ours is L_MAXMAJ (255), which no bdevsw slot (major < 32)
 * and no getudev consumer (major <= 127) can ever alias — the exact scheme
 * this tree already proved on metal, kept as the belt-and-suspenders default
 * in cdfs_makedev() for the unreachable case that a mount precedes cdfsinit()
 * (it cannot: mount(2) dispatches through the vsw_vfsops pointer that only
 * cdfsinit() installs).
